This is the HP11em: a C++, GTK, linux HP11C calculator emulator

It's still in development, and almost only 30% completed.

This emulator is released under GPLv3 license; for more information see the
COPYING file in the root of the project

To compile it you need to install 
	*libgtkmm-3.0-dev
	*libcln-dev
	*autoconf-archive

then you have to run aclocal and autoreconf in the project root

to have debug information run configure with --with-debug option

A lot of thanks to Torsten Manz, author of HP-15C Simulator (http://www.hp-15c.homepage.t-online.de),
from which I took the font I used to write the display
